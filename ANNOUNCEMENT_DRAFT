Dear MySQL Users,

a new version of MySQL Connector/C++ has been made available: MySQL Connector/C++ 1.0.2alpha. The MySQL Connector/C++ provides a C++ API for connecting client applications to the MySQL Server. You can download the alpha release at:

  http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/1.0.html

The MySQL Connector/C++ mimics the JDBC 4.0 API. JDBC is a commonly known and well designed API. The MySQL Connector/C++ alpha implements about 75% of the methods of the following classes of the JDBC 4.0 API:

 * Connection
 * DatabaseMetaData
 * Driver
 * PreparedStatement
 * ResultSet
 * ResultSetMetaData
 * Savepoint
 * Statement

Using MySQL Connector/C++ instead of the MySQL C API (MySQL Client Library) offers the following advantages for C++ users:

 * Convenience of pure C++ - no C function calls
 * Support of a well designed API - JDBC 4.0
 * Support of a commonly known and well documented API - JDBC 4.0
 * Support of the object oriented programming paradigma
 * Shorter development times

You can find further details, including usage examples, on the projects MySQL Forge wiki page at:

  http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Connector_C%2B%2B

A first documentation draft is available at:

  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/6.0/en/connector-cpp.html

Please note, the MySQL Connector/C++ is released as an alpha version. We do not recommend using the driver in production environments or systems with critical data. Please note, official support is not available for the alpha version of Connector/C++.

Feedback, bug reports, bug fixes, patches and so on are welcome and appreciated:
