This directory contains JDBC compliance tests and other tests ported from
our JDBC test suite. All tests are build as part of a reqular build of the
driver. The tests are compiled into one single binary "CJUnitTestsPort" located
in the directory of this README file.

Before running the tests you need to load a SQL dump into your test database.
The dump is located in the directory of this README file:

# mysql < cts.sql

Now you can invoke the test binary:

# CJUnitTestsPort

The test will try to connect to the MySQL server on the host "127.0.0.1" on port
3306 using TCP/IP and try to select the database "test" using the database user
"root" and the password "root"

You can pass other connection parameters to the test binary just like you can
with the examples from the examples/ directory. The syntax is like:

# CJUnitTestsPort tcp://<host>[:<port>] [username] [password] [database]

For example, to connect to 192.168.2.22 on port 3307, try:

# CJUnitTestsPort tcp://192.168.2.22:3307 user password database

The 1.0.2alpha release should pass about 95% of the tests.
