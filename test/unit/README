INTRODUCTION

This is the best place for regression tests. This is where you should
add a test when you fix a bug in the Connector. For historical reason
there are three distinct sets of tests for the driver:

tests/CJUnitTests/ <-- ported JDBC compliance/conformance tests
tests/unit/        <-- primarily regression testing
tests/static_test* <-- unclassified API tests, don't add code any more!

The first two sets of test are using the same unit testing framework.
All new tests of any kind (compliance, conformance, regression, ...),
shall be written using the unit testing framework contained in the source
of the MySQL Connector/C++.

If you work for MySQL Support or you would like to help us with a
full-featured bug report including a test case, here is what you need to
do.


HOW TO ADD A REGRESSION TEST

1) Identify a proper group, a proper directory for your test

  If there is a suitable directory for adding a new test proceed
  with step 2)!

  If there is no suitable directory, you need to create one by copying
  the directory template_bug_group/. For example, use:

   [# cd test/unit/ - this is where this README is :-)]
    # cp -R template_bug_group/ mygroup/

  Go to the directory mygroup/. It contains a CMake build file,
  two *.cpp and two *.h files. A pair of one *.cpp and the
  corresponding *.h file holds the test code for one bug and is
  compiled into one binary.

    a) A CMakeLists.txt build file
    b) bug123.cpp + bug123.h -> compiled into binary bug123
    c) bug456.cpp + bug456.h -> compiled into binary bug456

  Modify the template code as needed. Make sure you keep the
  CMakeLists.txt in sync with the code in the directory. Have a look,
  its Cut&Paste and Search&Replace that needs to be done.

  NOTE: You must "register" the new directory at the CMakeLists.txt
  found in the parent directory of your mygroup/ directory before you
  can build it.

  At the end of the CMakeLists.txt (from test/unit/), you will find:
