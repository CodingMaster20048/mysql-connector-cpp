PREREQUISITES FOR BUILDING CONNECTOR/C++

  The MySQL Connector/C++ is based on the MySQL client libary (MySQL C API).
  Connector C/C++ is linked against the MySQL client library. You need to have
  the MySQL client library installed in order to compile the Connector/C++.

  Typically the MySQL client library gets installed by installing
  the MySQL Server. However, check your operating system documentation for
  other installation options.

  You need to have CMake 2.6.2 (http://www.cmake.org).
  NOTE: cmake binaries are available for most systems. You do not need to build
  cmake yourself.


INSTALLATION ON UNIX

  The MySQL Connector/C++ is using the cross platform make CMake. CMake
  creates classical Makefiles. Please visit http://www.cmake.org for
  further information and documentation.

  1. Run CMake to build a Makefile

    me@host:/path/to/mysql-connector-cpp> cmake .
    -- mysql_config was found /usr/bin/mysql_config
    -- MySQL Include dir: /usr/include/mysql
    -- MySQL Library    :
    -- MySQL Library dir: /usr/lib64/mysql;/usr/lib64
    -- MySQL CFLAGS: -I/usr/include/mysql -fmessage-length=0 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector -DPIC -fPIC -DUNDEF_HAVE_INITGROUPS -fno-strict-aliasing
    -- MySQL Link flags:
    -- MySQL Version: 5.0.51
    -- MySQL Include dir: /usr/include/mysql
    -- MySQL Library dir: /usr/lib64/mysql;/usr/lib64
    -- MySQL CFLAGS: -I/usr/include/mysql -fmessage-length=0 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector -DPIC -fPIC -DUNDEF_HAVE_INITGROUPS -fno-strict-aliasing
    -- MySQL Link flags:
    -- Installation path is: /usr/local   (overwrite with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/path)
    -- Configuring cppconn
    -- Configuring examples
    -- Configuring test cases
    -- No MiniCppUnit
    -- Configuring done
    -- Generating done
    -- Build files have been written to: /path/to/mysql-connector-cpp


  Read on at point 3) in case of configure problems.

  2. Use make to build the libraries

    me@host:/path/to/mysql-connector-cpp> make clean
    me@host:/path/to/mysql-connector-cpp> make
    Scanning dependencies of target mysqlcppconn
    [  2%] Building CXX object driver/CMakeFiles/mysqlcppconn.dir/mysql_connection.o
    [  4%] Building CXX object driver/CMakeFiles/mysqlcppconn.dir/mysql_constructed_resultset.o
    [...]
    [ 97%] Building CXX object test/CMakeFiles/driver_test.dir/driver_test.o
    Linking CXX executable driver_test

  If all goes well, you will find the Connector/C++ library in
  /path/to/driver/libcppmysqlcppconn.so . In case of problems read on below
  before you ask for assistance.

  If you want to install the libraries on your system proceed with make install.

  me@host:/path/to/mysql-connector-cpp> make install

  3. CMake options: MySQL installation path, debug version and more

  In case of configure and/or compile problems check the list of CMake options:

    me@host:/path/to/mysql-connector-cpp> cmake -L
    [...]
    CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY:STRING=2.4
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local
    EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH:PATH=
    LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH:PATH=
    MYSQLCPPCONN_GCOV_ENABLE:BOOL=0
    MYSQLCPPCONN_TRACE_ENABLE:BOOL=0
    MYSQL_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/mysql_config

  For example, if your MySQL Server installation path is not /usr/local/mysql
  and you want to build a debug version of the MySQL Connector/C++ use:

    me@host:/path/to/mysql-connector-cpp>
    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -D MYSQL_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/my/mysql/server/bin/mysql_config .

  Verify your settings with cmake -L:

    me@host:/path/to/mysql-connector-cpp> cmake -L
    [...]
    CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY:STRING=2.4
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local
    EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH:PATH=
    LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH:PATH=
    MYSQLCPPCONN_GCOV_ENABLE:BOOL=0
    MYSQLCPPCONN_TRACE_ENABLE:BOOL=0
    MYSQL_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/my/mysql/server/bin/mysql_config

  Procees with make clean; make as described at point 2.)

  NOTE: cmake does cache settings in the file CMakeCache.txt.
  Make sure that cmake does not use old and unwanted settings from
  CMakeCache.txt. This may cause compile problems. If so, delete CMakeCache.txt,
  configure custom settings with cmake -D, if any and try compiling again.

INSTALLATION ON SOLARIS

  Use the Sun compiler to build the MySQL Connector/C++.

  Ensure that your environment points cmake to the appropriate compiler
  binaries. The binary distributions of the MySQL Server are build using Sun
  compilers. The MySQL tool mysql_config returns compiler flags suitable for
  Sun compilers but possibly not suitable for GCC. If you plan to use GCC on
  Solaris to compile MySQL Connector/C++, you might need to insert

  SET(MYSQL_CFLAGS "")

  at the end of the file /path/to/mysql-connector-cpp/FindMySQL.cmake.
  However, its recommended to use Sun Studio on Solaris.
  No changes are required when using the Sun compilers!

  Make sure that you do not mix Sun compilers with GNU compilers when building
  the MySQL Connector/C++. For example, do not use GCC as a C compiler and
  Sun CC as a C++ compiler. The linker might fail to link the results
  from both compilers to one binary.


INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS

  The MySQL Connector/C++ is using the cross platform make CMake. CMake
  creates classical Makefiles. Please visit http://www.cmake.org for
  further information and documentation.

  You need to have the environment variables set for the Visual Studio
  toolchain. Visual Studio includes a batch file to set these for you,
  and installs a shortcut into the Start menu to open a command prompt
  with these variables set.

  You need to set MYSQL_DIR to point to where the MySQL server is
  installed, using the short-style filenames:

   set MYSQL_DIR=C:\PROGRA~1\MySQL\MYSQLS~1.0

  Build Connector/C++ using the "cmake" command-line tool by doing the
  following from the source root directory (in a command prompt window);

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 8 2005"

  This produces a project file that you can open with Visual Studio or
  build from the command line with either of:

   devenv.com MySQLCPPCONN.sln /build Release
   devenv.com MySQLCPPCONN.sln /build RelWithDebInfo

  To compile the "Debug" build, you must run set the cmake build type so
  the correct version of the MySQL client libraries are used:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 8 2005" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
     devenv.com MySQLCPPCONN.sln /build Debug

  Upon completion; you will find the executables in the subdirectories of the
  "bin" and "lib" directories.

  Different versions of CMake come with different "generators". A generator
  is the component of CMake that is responsible for writing the build files.
  If, for example, cmake --help does not list a generator for
  Visual Studio 9 2008, try a more recent version of CMake.

  The MySQL Connector/C++ distribution contains the following directories:

  |-- common               <-- Commonly used infrastructure
  |-- cppconn              <-- Header files of the public interface
  |-- driver               <-- Connector/C++ source code
  |-- examples             <-- Basic examples
  `-- test                 <-- Tests, so to say: more examples
